How to submit kernel changes
============================

Please try to follow the guidelines below. This will make things
easier on the maintainers. Not all of these guidelines matter for every
trivial patch so apply some common sense.

Tips for patch submitters
-------------------------

1.	Always *test* your changes, however small, on at least 4 or
	5 people, preferably many more.

2.	Try to release a few ALPHA test versions to the net. Annouce 
	them onto the kernel-alpha channel
	(in Discord: https://discord.gg/mmZQSAB) and await results.
	This is especially important for device drivers, because
	often that's the only way you will find things like the fact
	version 3 firmware needs a magic fix that you don't know about,
	or some clown changed the chips on the board and not its name. 
	(Don't laugh! Look at the SMC etherpower for that.)

3.	Make sure your changes compile correctly in multiple 
	configurations. In particular check that changes work both as a
	module and built into the kernel.

4.	When you are happy with a change make it generally available for
	testing and await feedback.

5.	Happy hacking.
