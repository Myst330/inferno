	Hydra/Inferno kernel
 =================================

What is Hydra/Inferno?
----------------------

  Hydra/Inferno is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by
  Ariston Lorenzo with assistance from a loosly-knit team of hackers across the 
  Net. 

  It will have all the features you would expect in a modern Unix system,
  including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading,
  shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, and multistack
  networking including IPv4 and IPv6.

  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License v2 - see the 
  accompanying COPYING file for more details. 

On what hardware does it run?
-----------------------------
  
  We will first start with ARM-based PCs and then slowly we will move to
  Intel IA-64 and AMD x86-64 architectures. 

  Hydra/Inferno is easily portable to most general-purpose 32-bit or 64-bit 
  architectures as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and
  a port of the GNU C Compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC).
  Hydra/Inferno has also been ported to a number of architectures without a 
  PMMU, although functionality is then obviously somewhat limited.
  Hydra/Inferno has also been ported to itself. We will make it so you can run
  the kernel as a userspace application - this is call UserMode Hydra (UMH).
